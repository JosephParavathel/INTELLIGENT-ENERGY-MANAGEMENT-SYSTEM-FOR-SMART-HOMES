# INTELLIGENT-ENERGY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-FOR-SMART-HOMES

This project aims to develop an intelligent energy management system for smart homes using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes energy usage patterns of various devices in a smart home and uses machine learning algorithms to minimize energy consumption. The dataset used in the project consists of energy data from home appliances and weather information.

### Project Overview

The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way devices are connected and communicate with each other. In an IoT-enabled smart home, appliances and devices are interconnected through the internet, allowing remote control and automation of various functions such as security, temperature, and lighting. This project leverages IoT technology to create a system that optimizes energy consumption in smart homes.

### Objectives

Estimating Power Consumption: Analyzing the energy usage patterns of different home appliances at different times and seasons.
Predicting Solar Power Generation: Estimating the energy generated by solar power under different climatic conditions.
Detecting Anomalous Energy Consumption: Identifying abnormal energy consumption by home appliances.
Investigating System Efficiency: Evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed energy management system.

### Methodology

Data Exploration: Perform descriptive statistics, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis on the energy data and visualize the consumption patterns of devices.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilize machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, and random forests to predict energy consumption based on environmental factors and device status.
Energy Management System: Develop an energy management system that utilizes the predicted energy consumption values to control devices and optimize energy usage.
Evaluation: Assess the effectiveness of the energy management system in reducing energy consumption while maintaining user comfort.
Results
The project demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed energy management system in minimizing energy consumption in smart homes. By analyzing energy usage patterns and using machine learning algorithms, the system effectively predicts and optimizes energy consumption. The project provides insights into the energy usage patterns of various devices and showcases the potential of machine learning in promoting sustainable living and reducing energy bills.
